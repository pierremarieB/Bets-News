# Bets-News

## PROJECT STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Bets & News is a surveillance software of sports bets' websites designed to assist regular gamblers. The goal is to monitor and investigate the dependencies between betting quotas and news of a registered football team. 

On the basis of the news of a given team as well as its game history, we are able to create predictions of the next games' odds, while taking into account several other parameters (i.e. yellow/red cards, injuries, return of European/International competition, etc.). In addition, general information about the team is being displayed.
